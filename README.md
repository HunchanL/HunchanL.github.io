# About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Boston University, advised by Prof. [Sheila Russo](https://sites.bu.edu/mrl/). My research focuses on the design, fabrication, and control of soft robots for medical applications. Previously, I worked as a researcher at the medical device startup inTheSmart Co., Ltd., where I contributed to the development of advanced medical imaging systems. I received both a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University, where I worked with Prof. [Raymond Cipra] (https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=23824).
